## About

I am an analytically driven, curious, and communicative person who loves to challenge himself. Currently a graduate student in Analytics at The University of Chicago, I spent my previous academic and professional career in finance and banking, studying in Germany, Korea, China, and Ireland and working in banking for about 3 1/2 years. I came to the US in Spring 2019 for two reasons: First, extend my statistical and programming knowledge, two things I have enjoyed doing during my time in finance, but that I was missing real in-depth knowledge about. And, secondly, challenge myself by studying abroad, meeting new people and diving into American culture. It has been worth every minute! Now, I am looking for full-time opportunities where I can bring in my analytical skills and business acumen in an international team to help my future employer succeed and to further grow my career.<br><br>

When I am not working or learning, I love playing soccer or going for a run and I am also trying to pick up some Russian at the moment. Another hobby of mine is cooking, especially when friends are around (It's really more about good conversations than the perfect meal).<br><br>

If you would like to get in contact, shoot me a message on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-wehr) or send me an [email](mwehr@uchicago.edu). I am always happy to chat!<br><br>
