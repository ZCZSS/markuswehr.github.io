I am currently a graduate student in Analytics at the University of Chicago originally from Germany. Previously, I have studied Management, Finance, and Accounting and I have worked in banking and consulting for about 3 1/2 years. In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer or going for a run and I am also trying to pick up some Russian.
