  Welcome to my personal website! 
  I am currently a graduate student in Analytics at the University of Chicago originally from Germany. 
  Previously, I have studied Management, Finance, and Accounting and I have worked in banking and consulting for about 3 1/2 years.
  In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer or going for a run and I am also trying to pick up some Russian. Please check out my site to learn more!
